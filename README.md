This is to help people who need documents or materials related to servicenow .

You can contribute this repository by uploading the documents, ppts, materials and so on.

Steps to upload:

Send Email to dev32666@service-now.com with attachments you want to upload and a subject (make sure subject doesn't contain Req: re: etc; Fwd: allowed)

Email subject will be used by the system to create the folder and places the attachments from your mail under the newly created folder.

You will get a reply with the file links uploaded. 

If you didn't get any reply success/failure then the issue might be with attachments size. Remove some and send again; send remaining attachments by another mail with the same subject.

Try to send with meaningful Email subject so it will be easy to search for others.

If you face any error try to change the subject/attachment name because right now the system doesn't support overwriting.

Thanks.
